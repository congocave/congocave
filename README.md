This is a software design  document for a fictional company that wanted  to create a game similar to "Win, Lose, or
Draw." The textbook was from 2018, so imagined thier hardware was was from 2014. I tried to suggest cloud computing
solutions (which may seem anachronistic) as an alternative.

I didn't learn anything about solid state technology, so I couldn't include that in my analysis.

Please enjoy.
